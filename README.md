# Hi, I'm Tyler Maire

I'm a bioinformatics and data analysis enthusiast with a background in molecular biology and a passion for solving real-world problems with code. I’m currently building custom pipelines in Python for genomic and microbiome data, including 16S metagenomic analysis, and exploring the use of machine learning for biological datasets.

## What I’m Working On

- Developing reproducible workflows for microbiome and genomic data analysis  
- Creating tools for 16S rRNA data processing and visualization  
- Building interactive dashboards for data exploration (Streamlit, Power BI, Tableau)  
- Automating data cleaning and statistical testing in R and Python  

## Interests

- Bioinformatics  
- Data science and statistical modeling  
- Cancer research and precision medicine  
- Open-source software development

## About Me

I use he/him/they pronouns. Before transitioning to a career in bioinformatics, I worked as a professional brewer and earned several national awards. I bring the same curiosity, precision, and creative thinking from brewing into my scientific and analytical work today.
